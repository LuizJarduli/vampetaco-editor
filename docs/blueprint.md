## Style Guidelines:

- (#4F990C) to convey energy and call attention.
- Light gray (#F0F0F0), for a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the imagery
- A desaturated blue (#82B1FF) to complement the orange with a cooler tone, primarily for interactive elements
- 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a modern, clean and highly readable aesthetic.
- Simple, outline-style icons for tools and actions.
- A clean, intuitive layout with the image editing area as the focal point.
